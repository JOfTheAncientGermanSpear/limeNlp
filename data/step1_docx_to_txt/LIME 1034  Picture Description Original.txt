Cooke Theft
This looks like a kitchen with the mother washing dishes and shes got a skin overflowing she looks like shes got a very nice back yard thats kind of manicured with   shrubbery and what not   shes got a son I assume thats trying to get cookies out of a cookie jar hes falling off of a stool the daughter looks like shes reaching for cookie and not aware that hes falling off the stool   the mother has on an apron and not many people wear aprons anymore these days but shes got a nice   nice kitchen with nice storage area   ki   ki     she has   curtains on   at her window where she can look out of her her   window into the yard   there looks lie there is a tree outside of the no maybe thats a driveway that has some un flowers or something at the end of   driveway but thats either another part of her house or neighbors house   that she can look out of her window at   so there actually look like two catastrophes going on at the same time the sink overflowing and the son about to fall off of the stool   shes got some dishes dried   but looks like she forgot to turn the faucet off and the daughter looks like she might be  laughing a little bit that hes actually about to fall being a typical sister maybe the children are very

ok this is the one I saw yesterday with the family   its kind of hard to determine if its if their at their house or if their at     cabin kinda thing   theyve got a flag in the yard   with a nice tree and manicured yard with shrubbery   the parents Im assuming are on the blanket   relaxing   the father is reading     book hes kicked his sandals off the mom  looks like she might be pouring either soda or a glass of wine their listening to music   the son is playing with his kite and the dog is running along with him while his sister is   making a sandcastle   by the shore   theres   boat off in the distances a sailboat   with looks like two people on it and then theres a gentleman on the dock who just caught a fish so he seems to be real excited about that they seem to be having a very nice afternoon   enjoying things that they like to do the mom is in tennis shoes while the dad kicked his sandals off theres a car parked in the yard Im assuming that belongs to them and again I can't tell whether it their personal home or its like a camp I mean a a cabin or something you dont see a lot of flags in peoples yards so thats why I kind of thought it might be a cabin or something but it could be their house   its right on the edge of
