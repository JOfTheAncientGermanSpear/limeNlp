ok. I've done this one. There's a boy and a girl sitting on the beach. And there's sandals on the shoes, and she's pouring coke, in a glass, and she has a radio. There's a boy holding a kite, and he has a dog behind him. And there's a house with a car in the front, and a big tree, and a flag. And there's a boy holding a flag, and he's, has a little puppy following him. And there's a man on the river who is catching a fish. There's a little girl playing with the sandbar in the in the sand. And a boat with the number four seventy on it. And a lot of trees, and one big tree in in the yard.there are, there's a lion, and there's a man who's in charge of the lion. And there two little black children in the left hand side of the screen. And there's a, a popcorn man with a hat on, and circles around him, and stripes, and flowers on his bouquet, on his tie. And there three family members to the right, there's a lady, and a young boy, and a young girl. There is a high wire person going across on little, one of the little braids that goes across, the, the, the scenery. And then there is a lady riding a horse with a fancy dress on, and she has her hands out straight. And then there are some children, I'm not sure who they are, but they they look as if they are like kids. And I guess that's all. And there wires around the, the lion, and on the top they have some designs.
ok, you want me to tell you about it? ok there's a lady who is washing dishes, while the dishes are over flowing with a lot of water. And, there's a little boy looking up, o my goodness he's about to trample off the little, whatever you call it, little high stool. And he's getting a cookie, and he's going to give one to his sister, and one to himself. And there are some dishes on the table, and they have curtains in the windows, and you see another vision of a house and the tree, and leaves, and, a lot of cabinets. And the stool's getting ready to fall over.
