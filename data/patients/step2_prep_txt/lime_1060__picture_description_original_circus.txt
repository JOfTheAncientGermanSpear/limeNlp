Here we are at the zoo excuse me at the carnival as [*s:r] target = and, recurrent = 2 bozo the clown as the tightrope walker the lady on the horse the spectators and a merry go round the lion tamer and the little girl is watching bozo and little boy is pushing something looks to me like everyone is having a good time. Bozo is flipping [*s:r] target = throwing on something I cant tell what that is looks to me like maybe some pepper pants [*p:w] target = plants and the little girl and the mothers arms she is waiting to get some herself. Looks to me like just a typical circus type setting. I can’t tell weather that’s a big top or nothing. The lion he’s is performing real well for the tamer. You ready for the next type.
