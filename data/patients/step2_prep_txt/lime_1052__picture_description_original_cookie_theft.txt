o the mother is washing dishes the children are in the cabinet getting cookies and he didn't realize he's on the stool improperly and the stool is about to fall over on and the mother is making a big mess with all the water going on the floor   they have an interesting family their very   messy   and obviously they don't know it and what's that o that's the top to the cookie jar ok and he's handing her one and she's just laughing   yeah that's about it but I just don't understand why she has all that water all over the floor and then she has dishes on the sink and the only thing that's in the cabinet is the cookies I think he could have done that a little bit better cause his foot is off you know slightly and he's leaning back when he should be forward but the little girl is leaning back too and why does the mother look angry so and is she washing dishes or is she drying the dishes I don't know so that's about all I can say about that just a very dysfunctional household and so do I wait for my next picture o well look inside the window I guess you can see trees and grass the curtains I mean it's a pretty big kitchen window well they don't have a dishwasher so
