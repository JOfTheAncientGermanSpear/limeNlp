o this looks like a vacation time for the family by the lake and Im assuming that its not really in the country as such because its somewhat misleading that there is a sail boat on the water but the house has a road leading up to it that appears to be fairly private but more like an urban setting rather than a real country setting or distance setting and for some reason theres a flag out in in the yard which means it could be public park but may be not and that facility could belong to the person who maintains the area rather than the people visiting and the family is enjoying a picnic shes pouring a drink and hopefully thats evaon water rather than anything else and they have their little portable radio their sandals out and dad obviously has his sandals off mother has on flats or tennis shoes short enjoying herself and the son is enjoying his kite flying so that means that it is obviously a good day because the flag and the kite seem to be blowing in the same direction.  and another man who looks to be like he could be the ranger out there fishing but he is just a fisherman he has caught a fish and the little girl is building a sand castle and she is having a good time and the boaters are waving but no one seems to be waving back at them on the the sail says four seventy
