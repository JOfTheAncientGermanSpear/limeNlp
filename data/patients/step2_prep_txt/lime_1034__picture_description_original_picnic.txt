ok this is the one I saw yesterday with the family   its kind of hard to determine if its if their at their house or if their at     cabin kinda thing   theyve got a flag in the yard   with a nice tree and manicured yard with shrubbery   the parents Im assuming are on the blanket   relaxing   the father is reading     book hes kicked his sandals off the mom  looks like she might be pouring either soda or a glass of wine their listening to music   the son is playing with his kite and the dog is running along with him while his sister is   making a sandcastle   by the shore   theres   boat off in the distances a sailboat   with looks like two people on it and then theres a gentleman on the dock who just caught a fish so he seems to be real excited about that they seem to be having a very nice afternoon   enjoying things that they like to do the mom is in tennis shoes while the dad kicked his sandals off theres a car parked in the yard Im assuming that belongs to them and again I can't tell whether it their personal home or its like a camp I mean a a cabin or something you dont see a lot of flags in peoples yards so thats why I kind of thought it might be a cabin or something but it could be their house   its right on the edge of
