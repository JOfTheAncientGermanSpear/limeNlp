Boy this one oh. We got a picture this time okay I see someone with his hand in the cookie jar and someone waiting for a cookie and the mother is washing the dishes and splashing water all over the floor. Stool is about to slip out from beneath the son looks like there’s gonna be a big job cleaning up. Looks like they have a nice set of cabinets very well kept except the water running over the sink. And looks like the little girl is trying to tell her brother to hurry up with those cookies. And he’s got his hand in the cookie jar and handing her one too. Did I mention that stool looks like its about to fall in [*s:r] target = over and he’s about to fall with it.
