I see the mother washing the dishes. The child is stealing the cookies and the other child is receiving the stolen cookies. The sink is over flowing. Somebody has to clean up that mess. Um there’s more dishes to be washed. Wouldn’t hurt to paint the cabinets. I see a tree outside and a sidewalk lots of plants. The daughter might be left handed possibly. Uh moms got a sleeveless dress on apparently an apron.  Maybe chocolate chip cookies I could be projecting [*s:r] target = guessing. There’s some at my house. Um there’s a 90 degree angle from where the cabinet meets the counter right there. Um mom has got short hair. The son has dark hair. I’m assuming the daughter is blonde. Son is wearing tennis shoes, mom is wearing heels, the two children have socks on.
