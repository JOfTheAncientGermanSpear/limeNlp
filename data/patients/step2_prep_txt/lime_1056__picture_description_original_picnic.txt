I saw this one yesterday. Nice family vacation. They’ve driven to the vacation. They’ve got they must be in Maine because they got the beach and the trees and the water and the sailboat and the lake in Maine I’m thinking. You can bring your dog on this lake you can fish on this lake, you can be the good mother and pack the picnic with lots of wine while the husband sits there and reads his book like they all do. And you have a flag on the flagpole. I like the trees and bushes and water. No birds in this one.  Yeah that’s a sailboat. And make sand castles. Sit on blankets, fly a kite, chase the kid flying a kite. Listen to some music, like I said read a book, you should read lots and lots of books. Books are good. I still think they’re in Maine that’s where I would choose to go. Little girl build your sand castle then the little boy will run thru it with the dog and the kite which probably might get caught in the tree cause kites get caught in trees and then the dad can climb up the tree and retrieve the kite. And definitely not fall out because then we all know what happens when he falls out of the tree. That’s bad. Probably white wine. White wine is the best. Might be no its not champagne. But it could be champagne and there’s probably chicken and biscuits and potato salad inside the basket and some plates.
