MOTHER  






Cooke Theft
ok this is first of all this is a lady a young lady   washing or drying the dishes probably drying the dishes however she's not paying attention because she's overflowing the   sink from the faucet and it's dripping all over the floor   she has a toddler there who's reaching for the cookie jar and he's   not got a very good balances so he's about to tip it over which will probably result in knocking a hole in the top of his head   I notice   there's no   wind blowing there doesn't appear to be any snow however there do appear to be leaves on the trees that might be grass there but I'm just not sure about that   I believe she's in a bad mood because she's frowning and   let's see the little girl is poking fun at the little boy because he's about to fall on his rear end   I notice it   she has nice pretty anklet socks on and she's got a nice set of legs on her and she's got long long hair and   she look's almost like she's got on a   short skirt lie a cheerleader skirt and he's got on sloppy socks that would look like Pete Maravich with his dirty socks   I notice that there's     there's nothing else here well I don't know what that is that looks like a plate and I don't know what that is

Picnic
O this looks like this is not a beach house but this is a lake house it looks like and it's in the summertime even though it's a little early or   probably   little   late in the spring for them to be flying a kite even though it has a tail on it and also has a cord wrapped around so he can guide and keep the the kite from going into the sky there's the water on the lake and there's a sailboat and there's a special number on there for the number four seven zero I don't know what it's for but it's for that's a guy that's there on the dock and   and it's extending into the water and he's got a fishing pole   and he's pulling a fish out of the lake and it's splashing as the fish is messing around there I see the pretty leaves on the on the on the big tree out there and nice bushes and everything a nice clean cut house and a nice car parked in the garage although it's only a single car garage  I don't know what that's a flag it might might be   something special that that they call or its for where they live it looks like mommy and daddy are sitting there doing a t picnic   they both have their sandals on there's a transistor type radio or a boom box I guess they call it and I don't know if that's ginger ale or beer probably beer and their got their leisure clothes on he's reading a book that's the picnic basket and it's full of sandwiches and hot dogs and hamburgers I mean I've never seen so many in my life and there's the doggie and his name is obviously Bowzer and he's got his tag on means he's in good shape so
