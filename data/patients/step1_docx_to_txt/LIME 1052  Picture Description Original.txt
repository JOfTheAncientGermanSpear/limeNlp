Cooke Theft
o the mother is washing dishes the children are in the cabinet getting cookies and he didn't realize he's on the stool improperly and the stool is about to fall over on and the mother is making a big mess with all the water going on the floor   they have an interesting family their very   messy   and obviously they don't know it and what's that o that's the top to the cookie jar ok and he's handing her one and she's just laughing   yeah that's about it but I just don't understand why she has all that water all over the floor and then she has dishes on the sink and the only thing that's in the cabinet is the cookies I think he could have done that a little bit better cause his foot is off you know slightly and he's leaning back when he should be forward but the little girl is leaning back too and why does the mother look angry so and is she washing dishes or is she drying the dishes I don't know so that's about all I can say about that just a very dysfunctional household and so do I wait for my next picture o well look inside the window I guess you can see trees and grass the curtains I mean it's a pretty big kitchen window well they don't have a dishwasher so

Picnic
O wow this is at a picnic o are they at home I kinda wonder if their at home because the what looks like a house with the car in the front has a flag post and a flag so that may or may not be a house but it has a garage that's that's kind of an odd thing I've never seen anyone with an actual flag post and posted in the front yard that's odd too that they have a driveway that goes in front of the house yeah that's really weird so I guess not   cause it looks like there's a walkway to the front door and then you have the mother and the father and the child I see some sandals those must belong to the little girl who's playing with sand and he's reading a book no maybe those are his shoes but those look like girl sandals that's kinda odd and she's she's just pouring a drink and over to the far end is is a man and he is fishing there's a lot to do in this picture there's boating  and then he's flying the kite and he's running and the dog is chasing him but that's just really odd that house is just interesting   I don't know what it is about that house but the boat is out there this this could at like lake Murry and somnebody lives on the doc on the lake and they have a dock   and that's just you know a friend out there fishing but
