Circus
There’s a man on a tightrope. There’s a lion trainer. There’s a clown throwing something on the kids. The lady is holding a baby. They’re all watching the clown. There’s a lady on the horse, and there’s 3 rings, 1,2 there’s two rings. She’s riding the horse and doing well she’s kneeling on the horse showing [*s:uk] doing balance one two three one two three four five there five six people sitting on the bench watching her. And all together there’s one two three children two adults and the lion is sitting on his paws his back paws sitting up straight. That’s it. No that’s it. I said the man on the tight rope right there. That’s it. Unless you guys want me to describe the landscape.  Bushes In the landscape. The clown has a hat on with a feather. The lion tamer had a hat on. The man walking the tight rope is carrying a long stick for balance. That’s it.

Picnic
There’s a sailboat and far background, but not as far back as the bushes or trees. Coming towards us are the bushes and trees on the left side around the house with the car in the driveway a flagpole and then there’s a boy flying a kite and a dog chasing them but before you get to him there’s a man fishing there’s a fish on the line and he’s standing on the pier and there’s a little girl building a sand castle she has a shovel and a pail with her and there’s a old lady pouring the wine again pouring that wine. And having a picnic with her husband or well having a picnic with some guy who’s reading a book. Sitting on a blanket with a picnic blanket. And the radio and the shoes off and did I mention the dog is chasing the boy. And that’s it. It looks like a pretty nice day. Sitting on the grass in the front yard of the house. There’s two people on the sailboat. That’s it. Some bushes around the house and a picture window.
