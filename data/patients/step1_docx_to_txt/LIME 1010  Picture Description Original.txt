Cooke Theft
I see a little whos asking for a cookies apparently from her brother who in on the stool about to fall hes reaching for cookies he has one in his had probably one for himself and one for her the cabinet door is open while mother is diligently a drying dishes while the sink is running over it is obviously plugged up and she has two dishes rather than three so I wonder why not she must have just feed her children cause theres only two and as I look ouside I see a nice path that obviously leads to a garage or to the home next door and it must be spring time because there are trees and bushes and mothers gonna slip if shes not careful because the water is under her feet and she seems to be oblivious to it or she is showing a bit of dismay on her face if not shes certainly not smiling but she is also seemingly ignoring her children and the and the one little girl seems to be saying shhh to the boy so that mom doesn't notice but she will when it goes crash and all the lower cabinet doors are closed and apparently she put the cookies up top so they wouldn't bother them but they have found their way to them and thats about all I can see

Picnic
o this looks like a vacation time for the family by the lake and Im assuming that its not really in the country as such because its somewhat misleading that there is a sail boat on the water but the house has a road leading up to it that appears to be fairly private but more like an urban setting rather than a real country setting or distance setting and for some reason theres a flag out in in the yard which means it could be public park but may be not and that facility could belong to the person who maintains the area rather than the people visiting and the family is enjoying a picnic shes pouring a drink and hopefully thats evaon water rather than anything else and they have their little portable radio their sandals out and dad obviously has his sandals off mother has on flats or tennis shoes short enjoying herself and the son is enjoying his kite flying so that means that it is obviously a good day because the flag and the kite seem to be blowing in the same direction.  and another man who looks to be like he could be the ranger out there fishing but he is just a fisherman he has caught a fish and the little girl is building a sand castle and she is having a good time and the boaters are waving but no one seems to be waving back at them on the the sail says four seventy
