Ready? Ok this is, first of all this is a lady, a young lady, washing or drying the dishes, probably drying the dishes. However, she's not paying attention because she's overflowing the sink from the faucet, and it's dripping all over the floor. She has a toddler there who's reaching for the cookie jar, and he's not got a very good balances, so he's about to tip it over, which will probably result in him knocking a hole in the top of his head. I notice there's no wind blowing there, doesn't appear to be any snow, however there do appear to be leaves on the trees. That might be grass there, but I'm just not sure about that. I believe she's in a bad mood because she's frowning. And let's see, the little girl is poking fun at the little boy because he's about to fall on his rear end. I notice it, she has nice, pretty, pinklet socks on, and she's got a nice-looking set of legs on her, and she's got long, long hair, and she look's almost like she's got on a, a short skirt, like a cheerleader's skirt. And he's got on sloppy socks, that would look like Pete Maravich with his dirty socks. I notice that there's. There's nothing else here, well I don't know what that is. That looks like a plate, and I don't know what that is.
