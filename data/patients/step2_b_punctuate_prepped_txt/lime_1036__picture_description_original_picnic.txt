ok seem like we're at a, on a lake. There's about one, two, five people, and a dog. There's one couple that's sitting on the lake on a blanket with a picnic basket and a radio. The lady is re, pouring a something out of a bottle. The man is reading a book. There's a car parked in the garage, with a big tree in the front yard. They have a flag pole to the right of the house. There also a man standing on the deck, on the deck of the lake, with the fishing pole, and there's fish on it. And there's a young man playing in the, flying a kite, he has the dog trailing him. And there's a girl to his right, in the sa, building a sand, look like playing in the sand with a, a bucket and a shovel. And then are inst, in the lake, there's a sailboat with two people on it. And the, the little girl, she seem to be building a sandcastle. And the man that's out in the lake fishing, seem like he's happy that he's catching fish. And the dog seem like he's happy running behind the little boy. And the people in the picture, the lady, the man's shoes is to his right. And a, that's about everything I can see in there. Two minutes a long time
