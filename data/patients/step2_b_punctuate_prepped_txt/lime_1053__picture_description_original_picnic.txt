Oh this looks like, this is not a beach house, but this is a lake house it looks like. And it's in the summertime, even though it's a little early, or probably too litle/ob little bit late in the spring for him to be flying a kite, even though it has a tail on it, and also has a cord wrapped around so that he can guide and keep the, the kite from going into the sky. There's the water on the lake, and there's a sailboat, and there's a special number on there for the number four seven zero, I don't know what it's for, but it's for. That's a guy, that's there on the dock and, and it's extending into the water, and he's got a fishing pole, and he's pulling a fish out of the lake, and it's splashing as the fish is messing around there. I see the pretty leaves on the, on the, on the big tree out there, and nice bushes and everything, a nice clean cut house, and a nice car parked in the garage, although it's only a single car garage. I don't know what that, that's a flag it might, might be something special that, that they call, or its for where they live. It looks like mommy and daddy are sitting there doing a tuh picnic, they both have their sandals on, and there's a transistor type radio, or a boom box I guess they call it. And I don't know if that's ginger ale or beer, probably beer. And their, got their leisure clothes on. He's reading a book. That's the picnic basket, and it's full of sandwiches and hot dogs and hamburgers. I mean I've never seen so many in my life. And there's the doggie, and his name is obviously Bowzer, and he's got his tag on, which means he's, he's in good shape so
