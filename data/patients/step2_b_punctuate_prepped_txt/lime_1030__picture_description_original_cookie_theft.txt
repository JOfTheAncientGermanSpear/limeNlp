All right. Ah well. There's a kitchen here. Boy's about to fall, taking things out of the cabinet. Looks like water's running over. And the sink looks like a nineteen fifties type of thing. Ok what's happening on the outside that window? can’t really tell. Ok. Somehow looks like a face out there. And there seems to be a bowl and plates on the counter over here with them, where the lady is standing. Ok. a girl over here, I guess she's reaching for whatever the boy's trying to pull out of the cabinet. That's not really a face on the window, is it? Just my eye's jacked up that bad I guess. Ok, I did say the sink is running over. He's trying get a cookie there, that says cookie jar, ok. Alright, I think I've said everything I see here, nothing else really stands out. Look like one of those mother knows best. You were too young to know that. I think that was the seventies kind of show. You weren’t born yet. Not even planned yet I don’t think
