ok, you want me to tell you about it? ok there's a lady who is washing dishes, while the dishes are over flowing with a lot of water. And, there's a little boy looking up, o my goodness he's about to trample off the little, whatever you call it, little high stool. And he's getting a cookie, and he's going to give one to his sister, and one to himself. And there are some dishes on the table, and they have curtains in the windows, and you see another vision of a house and the tree, and leaves, and, a lot of cabinets. And the stool's getting ready to fall over.
