Here we are at the zoo. Excuse me, at the carnival. As bozo the clown, as the tightrope walker, the lady on the horse, the spectators, and a merry go round, or the lion tamer. And, the little girl is watching bozo, and the little boy is pushing something. Looks to me like everybody is having a good time. Bozo, Bozo is flipping on something, I cant tell what that is, looks to me like maybe he's throwing them some pepper mints. And the little girl in the mother's arms, she is waiting to get some herself. Looks to me like just a typical circus type selling, setting. I can’t tell whether that’s under the big top or not. The, the lion, he’s performing real well for the, the tamer. You ready for the next type.
