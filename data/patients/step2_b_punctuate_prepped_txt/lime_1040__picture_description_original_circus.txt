air the people, a circus. And there's a man riding the wahl, on the water. There people sitting there and looking at anything. Why sitting there I have no idea, maybe that. There's a layer on the, pulling, the, cur horse is on this woman. There's a, there's a man and two family, and some kids throwing glasses on him. And here's a man throwing on the kid. Here's two people watch this, but no one seems to be talking to the amp, man trying to kill, play with, the, with the, with the line, but he's not dressing properly, he isn't wearing their outfit. He looks like he talks to people, a peacher. There's two people just looking at this guy not looking at that. No one's paying to this kid at all, she's doing everything by herselves. These people get throw this balown, cone, whatever his name is, is throwing at the kids, everyone's happy with that. This woman, OK no one's paying this kid, he get killed by the guy he doesn't know, by the lion. Look like a person, herdum. This two people, I dont know why they're doing. Look at this kid, she's look at this. There's gonna lot a work, and seems like nobody's looking at them all, and these guys are looking that way, and no one's paying attention to it. Those are three neat things going here, and nobody's paying attention, must make you crazy. Nobody look at this, this is pretty much nothing. This is a good thing to do, this is typhing, this is nothing, nobody's paying attention to him. These people don't pay attention to this thing at the circ, the circus, nobody cares. Looking at this, big things going here, and no one's looking.
