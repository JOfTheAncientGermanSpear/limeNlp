Oh boy, this is a busy one. This is a, looks like a circus or a carnival, probably a circus. There is a high wire balancer out there, and he's got his pole, his long pole that helps him keep his balance. There is the horse that runs around in the, in the inside of the circle, and the the girl is riding the horse, and, and, and she balances while the horse is going around the, around the circle. There's the clown there, and he's got on a nice looking sh/sh pair of striped pants with flowers on his tie, and he's got his red nose on there, and his garb and everything, and he's got a little flower coming out of his hat there, and he's got something probably like popcorn or something coming out of the pail there. There's a lion in the cage there, and he's up on one of those, I don't know what you call them, but it's like a tub, a a round tub. And he, the lion sits on that, and he balances himself upright. And the lion tamer, or he could be the actual, no he's the, he's the, he's the guy that that's the EMC, what do they call them for the, for the carnival. I forgot what you call them. But anyway, he's, he's working with the lion, to make sure he's tame and everything, and entertaining the folks. There is a, a grandstand. And there's the outlines of the people, they're actually watching the, the, the, the circus, the three ring circus, or it's actually a one ring circus. And those are the people that are watching, their the, the fans. And then you have, looks like mother
