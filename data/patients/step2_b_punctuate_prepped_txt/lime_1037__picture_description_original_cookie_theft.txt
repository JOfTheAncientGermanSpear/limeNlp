the woman's washing the dishes, while the, while their son is tipping in the chair, getting cookies. And the girl is snickering at him. The mothers, the dishes is overflowing. There's a, a window with curtains, two plates, one plate, and two bowls. She's, she's drying the dishes, but she left the water running. There's a big puddle on the floor. Let's see the, the kitch, the kitchen's fairly good size. It's got two, two pluh, two, two druh, two cabinets. And I, and it, it looks outside, to the gra, to the, to the, to the yard that has, that has grass, the other side of the house. Got curtains tied up so you can see outside. She's drying a plate. I can't see anything else. Looks like, looks like the boy might be wearing one shoe and one sock, it's hard to tell. But he's about to tip over. He does have a cookie in his hand, and it kinda looks like he is going to give to his sister, and he trying to get one for himself.
