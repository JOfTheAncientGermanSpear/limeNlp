Boy this one. We, we got a picture this time. Okay, I see someone in the, with his hand in the cookie jar, and someone waiting for a cookie. The mother is washing the dishes, and splashing water all over the floor. Stool is about to slip out from underneath the son. Looks like there’s gonna be a big job cleaning up. Looks like they has, has a nice set of cabinets, very well kept, except for the water running over the sink. And looks like the little girl is trying to tell her brother to hurry up with those cookies. And he’s got his hand in the cookie jar, and one, and handing her one too. Did I mention that stool looks like it's just about to fall in, and he’s gonna fall with it?
