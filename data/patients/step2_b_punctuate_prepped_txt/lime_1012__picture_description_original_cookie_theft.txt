oh kitchen. I see people getting into a cookie jar, with a jewel kind of trippin over, and a sink is over. That lady is in trouble, boy o boy, and the girl is giggling because her brother is on trouble. And the lady's walking in a puddle of water, she better get a mop. And, and I see some dishes on the side, and I don't know whether they are clean or dirty, but they're probably clean. And I see a kitchen counter that's a little cluttered, but not bad. And the curtains are nice, and the cookie jar is full, but not, but going empty. ok and it looks like he's already got one cookie and heading for another, his sister's reaching for the cookie too. How about that? It looks like it's probably chocolate chip. I see little specks, they all say chocolate chip Im sure. Well the girl has a day dress, what you call that? day-dr, I dont know, I dont know girls clothing. But she's got, looks like she's got leggings on of some kind, no that's the bottoms, the top's the socks, not the bottoms the bleggings. And loafers with kind of, kind of a bow on them. And he's got, kind of looks like boots, but wearing shorts and a, and a, a collared shirt. I cant tell whether it got pockets or not, but he's got, he's had a hair cut not too far in the past.
