ok. I've done this one. There's a boy and a girl sitting on the beach. And there's sandals on the shoes, and she's pouring coke, in a glass, and she has a radio. There's a boy holding a kite, and he has a dog behind him. And there's a house with a car in the front, and a big tree, and a flag. And there's a boy holding a flag, and he's, has a little puppy following him. And there's a man on the river who is catching a fish. There's a little girl playing with the sandbar in the in the sand. And a boat with the number four seventy on it. And a lot of trees, and one big tree in in the yard.
