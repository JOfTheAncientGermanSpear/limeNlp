It's got, he, one, two, two on the ma/man and the quirl, an two little ones. And they're looking at. And then all of a sudden she's looking at, at the drawing. And she's back and forth with it. And she's really good. She is, she's really, she's the girl with two little ones. And she got, the ga, and he's got picture, and she's got stuff here, so he's got some right now for her. And then this one is the guy with the little one girl, and they're doing really good. He wants to see if he's got something for her. And then, and then this is a cat, cat but it's more than that. And, no. And so he's gonna be back an forth with it, because he's he's supposed to be really good.
