I see a little girl who's asking for cookies apparently from probably her brother, who is on the stool about to fall, he's reaching for cookies. He has one in his hand, probably one for himself, and one for her. The cabinet door is open. While mother is diligently drying dishes, while the sink is running over, it is obviously plugged up. And she has two dishes, rather than three, so I wonder why not, she must have just fed her children cause there's only two. And as I look outside, I see a nice path that obviously leads to a garage, or to the home next door. And it must be spring time because there are trees and bushes. And mother's gonna slip if she's not careful, because the water is under her feet, and she seems to be oblivious to it, or she is showing a bit of dismay on her face. She's certainly not smiling, but she is also seemingly ignoring her children. And the, and the one little girl seems to be saying shhh to the boy so that mom doesn't notice, but she will when it goes crash. And all the lower cabinet doors are closed, and apparently she put the cookies up top so they wouldn't bother them. But they have found their way to them. And that's about all I can see.
