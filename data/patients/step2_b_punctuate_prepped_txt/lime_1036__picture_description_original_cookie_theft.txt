ok, young boy in the cookie jar, a little girl asking for a cookie. The mother's at the, a female's at the sink, the sink's overflowing, she has a dishcloth in her hand, wrenching trying phing. The mother seem to have an apron on. The little boy dressed in shorts, with a shir shirt, and the little girl is dressed in a shoot dress. The cookie jar is filled with cookies, with the top off it. And the mother's standing at over the sink watching the window with curtains. And showing the yard, the sink is over filling with water. There's some dishes on the counter top. The little boy is climbing in, up on a, a stool, and it seem to be falling over. And the little girl is, the doors are open to the pantry, and the little girl seem to be begging for a cookie. The mother, water is running all over her shoes. They seem to be in the kitchen, doing kitchen work, and the little boy seem to be falling down. That everything I can see and recognize.
