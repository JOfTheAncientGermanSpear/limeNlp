alright we got a little girl eating, wanting a cookie, that her brother's got on a stool, he's falling. it's got three legs, the sink's running over, water on the floor, her wiping or drying the dishes. The window is open, apparently on the bottom, and she is looking out into the back yard, or the front side of the house. you've got three bowls, or two bowls, and a two plates in the picture, you've got a cookie jar with a lid that's leaning against it. There are no shelves or handles, that are seen on the doors. You've got, your, the handles down here on the bottom, that are just pull locks, and not a little knob. You've got two faucets over here, and one large sink, and not a drying or rinsing side. you've got, the picture was probably done back in the late fifties, that sort of era because look at the little mini skirt, that the girls got or either the little thing down, and the pants come up around the ankles, depending on how that is since I can't tell the muscle description. That kid apparently is going to hit the back of his head the way he falls, he's not going to come down on his feet. And what sorta thing about the window and the curtains being drawn back, the tie backs there. You've got apparently either the, the walk around the house, the path, or the sidewalk that might be there. Got a couple of bushes in the yard. And she's wearing high heels at the sink doing dishes, a sleeveless shirt, or a blouse, dress, whatever that is, shes wearing an apron
