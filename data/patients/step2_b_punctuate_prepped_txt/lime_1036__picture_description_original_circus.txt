Seems like they're at a circus. See a a lion in a cage, with a man with a tuxedo on. They have a, a wire running over the thing, and the man is trying to walk the wire with a, a, a bar in his hand. Some people sitting there watching, it's two, four, five people sitting there watching the lungly lady on a horse, in a ring, and she's a, like a little ballerina, or something. And the clown seem like he's throwing, lettng some popcorn, some, something go to the kids that are watching. Seem like it's a lady, and a baby, and another young man watching. And there's, seems like a man and his daughter, a man and a gir to the left of the clown, she's pointing at the clown. The young man with his lady and a baby, he got his hand like he's trying to catch some of the stuff that's coming out of the clown bucket. The clown have on a clown suit with a rubber nose and a little cap on his head, and have a bucket in his hand that he. He has some big old trousers on, with suspenders and a neck tie. And the ballerina, she got a little short dress on with lace around it. And the clown also got a, a plower stickig out his hair. And the man in the cage with the lion, he just seem to be pointing at the lion, and the lion is on his vye, rear feet, with his two paws kinda.
