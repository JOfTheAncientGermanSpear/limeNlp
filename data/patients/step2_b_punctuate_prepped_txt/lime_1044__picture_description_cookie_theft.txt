Ok this woman is washing dishes, the sink is overflowing, and she's washing a plate, looking outside, outside of the window, watching the leaves. Beside her is a picture of a boy and girl. The boy is, is on a chair, and he's trying to get, the some cookies out of the cookie jar, and the boy is is falling, he's getting ready to fall. And, what else can I tell you? they're in the kitchen area, I see two, two bowls and a plate. And the woman has a skirt on, short hair. And the boy has shorts on, the girl has a skirt. They're looking outside as I said earlier, looking to the lawn. They can see, probably looks like a neighbor's yard, and I said earlier it's water is spilling into the table. Not sure what else to say about this. She looks like she's very nice. Look outside the window.
