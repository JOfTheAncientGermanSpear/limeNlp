All right. We have a nice little nineteen fifties housewife doing dishes in the sink, but she is letting the sink overflow, and it's getting her nice shoes all wet, but she doesn't seem to be too concerned.  While her son and daughter are getting cookies out of the cookie jar, but the son is about ready to fall off the stool. And, the window appears to be open, and it looks like it's a nice day outside. The girl is wearing a dress, along with her mother. The boy is wearing a nice little shorts, reminds me of stuff from leave it to beaver. They live in a tree lined neighborhood, and the houses appear to be, or the lawns appear to be, neatly kept. Trees appear to be fully mature. They don't have a lot of appliances in the kitchen, and, nor do they have a stove.
