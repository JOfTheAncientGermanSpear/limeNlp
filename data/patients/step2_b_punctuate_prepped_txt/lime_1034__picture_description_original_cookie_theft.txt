This looks like a kitchen with the mother washing dishes, and shes got a skin overflowing. She looks like she's got a very nice back yard, that's kind of manicured with shrubbery and, what not. She's got a son, I assume, that's trying to get cookies out of a cookie jar, and he's falling off of a stool. The daughter looks like she's reaching for cookie, and not aware that he's falling off the stool. The mother has on an apron, and not many people wear aprons anymore these days. But she's got a nice, nice kitchen, with nice storage area. Kih, kih, she has, curtains on, at her window, where she can look out of her, her window into the yard. There looks like there is a tree outside of, no maybe that's a driveway that has some, flowers or something at the end of driveway, but that's either another part of her house or a neighbor's house that she can look out of her window at. So there actually look like two catastrophes going on at the same time, the sink overflowing, and the son about to fall off of the stool. She's got some dishes dried, but looks like she forgot to turn the faucet off. And the daughter looks like she might be laughing a little bit that he's actually about to fall, being a typical sister maybe. The children are very neat
