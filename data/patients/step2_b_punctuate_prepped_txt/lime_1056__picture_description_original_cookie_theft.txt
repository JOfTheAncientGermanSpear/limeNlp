I see the mother washing the dishes. The child is stealing the cookies, and the other child is receiving the stolen cookies. Let's see, the sink is over flowing. Somebody has to clean up that mess. There’s more dishes to be washed. Wouldn’t hard to paint the cabinets. I see a tree outside, and a sidewalk, lots of plants. The daughter might be left handed, possibly. Mom's got a sleeveless dress on, apparently an apron. Maybe chocolate chip cookies, I could be projecting. There’s some at my house. There’s a 90 degree angle, where the cabinet, meeches the counter, meets the counter, right there. Mom has got short hair. The son's got dark hair. I’m assuming the daughter is blonde. The son is wearing tennis shoes, mom is wearing heels. The two children have socks on.
