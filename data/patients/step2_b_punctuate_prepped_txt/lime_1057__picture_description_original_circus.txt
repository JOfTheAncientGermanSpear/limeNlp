There’s a man on a tightrope. There’s a lion trainer. There’s a clown throwing something on the kids. The lady is holding a baby and they’re all watching the clown. There’s a lady on the horse, and there’s ring, 3 rings, 1,2 there’s two rings. She’s riding the horse, and doing, well she’s kneeling on the horse, showing the balance. One, two, three, one, two, three, four, five, there five, six people sitting on the bench watching her. And all together, there’s one, two, three children, two adults, and the lion is sitting on his paws, his back paws sitting up straight. That’s it. No that’s it. I said the man on the tight rope right? That’s it. Unless you guys want me to describe the landscape. Bushes in the landscape. The clown has a hat on with a feather. The lion trainer has a hat on. The man walking the tight rope is carrying a long stick for balance. That’s it.
