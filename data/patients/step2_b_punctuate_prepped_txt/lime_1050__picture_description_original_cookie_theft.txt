the woman is washing the dishes. the little boy is getting cookies. and the little girl is wanting the little boy to hand him, hand her some cookies. and the mother is wakes, wasting the water on the floor. and let me see what else. And the boy is tipping over the, the stool. and I think that's about it. the water's running on the floor. and the mom, like I said, washing the dishes, cleaning them, cleaning the mess. I think that's it. look like it's a sunny day.  the mom is probably making dinner. and the little boy is getting two cookies out the cookie jar. And the, the little girl is hungry. And let me see what else. And the mama got dishes on the table.
