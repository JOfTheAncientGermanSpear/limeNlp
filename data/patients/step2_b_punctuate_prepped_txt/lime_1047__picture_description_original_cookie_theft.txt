The little boy stealing cookies of cookie jar, he's standing on a stool that's getting ready to tip, the little girl is laughing at him. Mother's, is washing dishes, she has a solemn look on her face, so she's letting the water run over the sink. That's all I see. Little girl must be asking for a cookie, and he's laughing at him. Curtains. Looking out the window you see the pathway, the shrubbery, and the next door neighbor house. I think you see two bowls on the counter, one plate on the counter. Mother has a plate in her hand with a dish rag she's drying the plate. The little boy's given the little girl a cookie, and he's taking one for his self. And the mother's standing in water, where the water's running out the sink. One, two, there's three cabinet drawers/cabinet doors where the boy's taking the cookies out, two up under him. The water's splashing on the floor. I see trees outside, shrubbery outside, grass outside. Curtains are pulled/tied back. Mother has on a apron and wearing a dress. There's nothing else to say about it. There's a spicket, and two waterfalls, a hot water. Mother's wearing an apron, I don't know if I said that already. The little girl's wearing her dress, her hair is shoulder length. The boy hair is crew cut I'll say.
