There’s a sailboat, in the far background, but not as far back as the bushes or trees. Coming towards us is the bushes and trees on the left side, around the house, with the car in the driveway, a flagpole, and there’s a boy flying a kite, and a dog chasing him. but before you get to him, there’s a man fishing, there’s a fish on the line, and he’s standing on the pier. and there’s a little girl, building a sand castle, she has a shovel and a pail with her. and there’s a old lady in the wine hole again, pouring that wine. And having a picnic with her husband, or well having a picnic with some guy who’s reading a book. Sitting on a blanket with a picnic blanket. And the radio, and the shoes off, and did I mention the dog is chasing the boy? And that’s it. It looks like a pretty nice day. Sitting on the grass in the front yard of the house. There’s two people on the sailboat. That’s it. Some bushes around the house, and a little tree, and a picture window.
