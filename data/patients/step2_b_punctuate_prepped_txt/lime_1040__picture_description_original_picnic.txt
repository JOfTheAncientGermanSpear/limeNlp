This in the water, and a whole bunch of people here doing, I have no idea, doesn't make any sense, but here it is. There's a person here taking four seventy a boat, nice sailboat, that means it's a special time. There's a man catching a bear there, got a bish there. Then some, this kid is throwing up the, the night, kite, this is running this here. Guy's reading, and a woman's having the drink. The kids throw those things, and that maybe his hat, but you don't think he lives there, you don't know if he goes there, who lives there, who does anything, they're doing something.

Here's four seventy, a special type of sail bus. This is a lady just doing, making a des, I don't know why he's doing. He's pulling there. He's just sitting there, she on drink I guess. Here's a ladio playing nothing. He's got no feet on, so he hurt himself there. Here's another one without a foot on. Here's on a boat. The boat ends there, and ends there. Who could hit? You don't know who owes it. He believers here, we don't know if this guy owns it, perhaps. Here's a guy taking the boat. Here's a guy, pulling the kid on the place. He's pullin the dog, out on the kite, that's a nice thing. There's a man catching a fish, just making another drink.

It must be, it doesn't look like in the ocean, looks more like a ba, a pond, or a sea. He's catching a fish. I know what's going on, but it's crazy, people doing different things, not doing anything. All people do nothing. This guy's the only one there. This guy maybe he's there, we don't know if he's there. This guys pulling
