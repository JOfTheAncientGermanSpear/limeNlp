there are, there's a lion, and there's a man who's in charge of the lion. And there two little black children in the left hand side of the screen. And there's a, a popcorn man with a hat on, and circles around him, and stripes, and flowers on his bouquet, on his tie. And there three family members to the right, there's a lady, and a young boy, and a young girl. There is a high wire person going across on little, one of the little braids that goes across, the, the, the scenery. And then there is a lady riding a horse with a fancy dress on, and she has her hands out straight. And then there are some children, I'm not sure who they are, but they they look as if they are like kids. And I guess that's all. And there wires around the, the lion, and on the top they have some designs.
