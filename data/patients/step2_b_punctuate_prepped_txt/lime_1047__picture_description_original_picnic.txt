ok we're at the lake. First of all, I see a husband, or a wife, or a couple, I'll put it that way, sitting on a blanket. And she's, they're having a picnic, and she's pouring wine in a bottle and he's reading a book. Next to them is a little boy flying a kite, and the dog is running behind him. And, and further down near the beach, or the lakeshore, there's a little girl making a sandcastle, and next to her is a bucket and a pail which she gets her sand. Further around the lakeshore, there's a man fishing on a dock, he's caught a fish. There's a person sailing a boat on the lake. And there's trees. I guess this is resort house. There's a car in the driveway. It's a single story house. There's... Let's see, car's in the driveway, single story house, flying a kite. There's a flag flying in the yard. The little boy, going back, the little boy is laughing. The dog has his tongue sticking out and running, and he's happy. Everybody's happy on the, on the picture, even the lady that's pouring the wine. She has on shorts and a tank top, he has on shorts and shirt. He has his shoes off, she has her shoes on. There's a radio. Let's see, the lake goes all the way around. Abain I see trees, and shrubberies. And the waves is rolling up on the shore. And I don't know what to say about it. I don't see no birds, maybe there's one, that's one, maybe a speck, a bird in the sky.
