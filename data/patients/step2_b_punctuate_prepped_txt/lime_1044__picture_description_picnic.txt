so there's a picture of a man, and a woman. they're sitting at a blanket. the woman is pouring what appears to be wine, and there's a basket, and I see a radio beside the lady, and the man is a wearing sandals, and right beside the this nice little family there appears to be man who's  running with a kite, and the dog is chasing him. beside the the man, I'm sorry the boy, is a little girl who's at the beach, who's playing with sand, and she has a bucket, and a shovel. and in the back, in the back area there's a picture of an older man who appears to be fishing, and it looks like he has a fish on the end of the line. and in the back, in the back, you can see a sailboat with two people on the back of the sailboat. and there's also a picture of a, of a house, that has trees, and there's a flag, a flagpole. and in front of the car, there's a picture of car. and there's bushes behind the house. and the man who is fishing is standing on top of a dock. and looks like everyone's having a wonderful day. it's a happy day. man has glasses on, reading a book, of course.
