we had that one a while ago. Let's see we're going back on the picnic again. Dad's reading a book, mom's drinking some wine, sounds good to me. Listen to the radio. On a pretty day. Looks like they're. Dont know if that's a cabin or their house, must be that. Got a flag. Boy's flying a kite. The dog's changing the boy, the dog is changing the boy. Looks like grandpa's over fishing, got him a big one. I see some coulds over in the, no that's not, that's not clouds, that's tree, or woods, trees. I see sailboat, number four seventy. Two guys and they're waving. Little girl's playing in the beach in the sand, and she's got a shovel, and a bucket, bucket, yeah. The boy's wearing tennis shoes. House is white. Dad's getting old, he's got white hair too. I'm having fun. He took his sandals off his hands. Sitting on a blanket. Picnic basket. No food, just wine.
