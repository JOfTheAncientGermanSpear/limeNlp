The, the this is where the circus, and I see a lion, and a lion tamer. the lion is standing on his, on his back. and in front of the, the, the room, I see a picture of a man, he's there with his little girl. and, I see a clown, the clown has a hat, a rose on his hat, and he apparently is throwing balloons, balloons, not balloons. he's showing, I can't think of the word, i can't think he's showing. a man with another little girl and boy. and then I see a horse, and a ring, and the lady's on top of the horse. they're going in circles in the ring. and then on top of that I see a man, see him walking, skate walking, skate walking, some kind of walking. and behind the, the ring, I see some blacked out people folks, it looks like there's four, or five folks, can't see their faces.
