Circus meets the fair. Everybody hates clowns. And I think that making lions do tricks is torture. It’s abusive and the lion should definitely eat the dude that’s in there with him. And then we go to the circus where the lady is also abusing the horse. And there’s a trapeze guy, keeping his balance with a pole. There looks like there might even be some birds, so they possibly might be outside. And the children with their mother, or probably their grandmother, 'cause nobody’s mother has time to take them anywhere. And then there’s possibly some black, a black man with his daughter, maybe. And then there’s some shadow people over there by the horse. It’s probably there in silhouette. Horses should not be made to run around in circles, momma doesn’t like that. The lady on the horse needs more clothes on. There’s mountains possibly, so there should be outside. Oh, the clown is throwing probably candy, at the children. The little girl is pointing to the lady on the horse, who is a criminal in my opinion. Let's see one, two, three, four stars around the ring. And, what else can I see? Probably some grass around. Little pigtails and bows on the little girl. Isn’t she cute. Clowns wear hats, and stripes, and vest with flowers on them, and red noses, and they’re disgusting and nobody
