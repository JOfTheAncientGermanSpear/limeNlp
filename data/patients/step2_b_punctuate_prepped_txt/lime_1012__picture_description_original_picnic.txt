We have a, it's not a dark this time, so it looks like it's been done by a different artist. A young man is kite flying. And there's a sail boat on the lake. And somebody's fishing, caught a fish too. how about that? You got a girl playing, on a, in a, in a sandy beach building, a sand castle. You got a, you got a pouring pop into a glass at a picnic area down here. The radio's going, I bet it's doing some, some, of some, some common songs. And we have the young man reading a book, I guess he's telling a story to the girl. He's got his shoes off too, he took his sandals off. and, and, it must be their, their own yard, because he's parked outside of a garage. and it's a nice little bungalo. And got a flag flying in, in the, in the side yard. And looks like a shingled roof, not a tin roof. And looks likes a well kept garden, with landscaping around the house. The guy fishing is out on a pier, they must have been there for a little while and, and adapted it to their own use. And he's got a ranger hat on, i wonder if he's a ranger. And he's got some kind of, of vest on, probably got all his flies and fishing tack all in that vest. And what is that? I don't, I can't tell the model of the car from this picture, but it's fairly modern. And the guy's got long pants on, so he's probably, he might be a doll snart.
