so the girl and the boy are picking up food, up high. The lady is, the lady is washing her food, and not paying attention the water is coming down on the floor. She's looking at the man in the other room, I guess. And the boy who's picking up the food up above, is getting ready to fall off. I cant think of anything else. She's looking outside, but I can't really understand what. I thought she was looking outside, I thought maybe somebody was cutting the grass or something, but I dont see no person cutting the grass, but she's looking. Did the house burn or something? cause I'm looking straight up in there, is the house burning? I cant tell that. But yeah like I said outside I can see, but cant understand what's going on. Like she looking at somebody, but main thing is the water is dripping onto the floor. She's wearing a dress, I cant believe wearing a dress, but any way. I said the man, the girl, and a boy getting food. Going up high up to get food. And the man is falling off. And the lady is not looking as she washing the clothes, and dripping the water down
