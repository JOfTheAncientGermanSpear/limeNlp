This looks like a vacation time for the family by the lake. And I'm assuming that it not really in the country as such, because it's somewhat misleading that there is a sail boat on the water, but the house has a road leading up to it, that appears to be fairly private, but more like an urban setting rather than a real country setting, or distance setting. And for some reason there's a flag out in in the yard, which means it could be public park, but may be not. And that facility could belong to the person who maintains the area, rather than people visiting. And the family is enjoying a picnic, she's pouring a drink, and hopefully that's evaon water rather than anything else. And they have their little portable radio, their sandals out, and dad obviously has his sandals off, mother has on flats, or tennis shoes, shorts enjoying herself. And the son is enjoying his kite flying so that means that it is obviously a good day because the flag, and the kite, seem to be blowing in the same direction. And another man who looks to be like he could be the ranger out there fishing, but hopefully he is just a fisherman, he has caught a fish. And the little girl is building a sand castle, and she is having a good time. And the boaters are waving, but no one seems to be waving back at them. On the the sail says four seventy, so that might be a good.
