ok same thing. Alright, there's a clown there throwing popcorn out at the kids. There's a gentleman there with his daughter. And there's the man, doing something with the lion, it is a loin. And the children are happy to go to that, and they are watching the lady traipsing around the screen on the little outdoor thing, little outdoor wheel. And then there's some people in the background looking at the show. And there's a man up on the top. he’s, what do they call them?, he's not trapeze, he's not trapeze, he's walker? I don't know what you name him, but there's something. There’s a name for him, but I can’t think of it right now. But the, the clown has popcorn and he has a flower shirt on. And, and the girl has locks in her hair, her little things to lock to hold her hair down. And, and that's about it. That's about all I can put there
