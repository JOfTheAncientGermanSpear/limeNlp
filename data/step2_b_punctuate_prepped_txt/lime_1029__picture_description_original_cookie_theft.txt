The boy is stealing cookies out of the cookie jar to give to his sister. Up, he's up on a stool, and he's about to fall. And the mama's washing the dishes, and she wasting water all over the floor, and she's not noticing the children. And she's, she's watchin and drying dishes, and if she's not careful, mother is gonna slide down on the floor and she'll be down on the floor with the little boy too, and the girl is the only one that's gonna be standing. And that's all I know about the picture. And mother has on her nice dress and shoes. And look like the little boy has on a pair of socks, and a pair of shoes, and his hair. All of them have combed nicely. She gonna have ta turn that water off, unless she have gonna have a high water bill too. She, there must be a just finishing up supper. What is it? The curtains, them open so she can see out the door. And it is a beautiful scenery out the door. Looks, one thing about it, it's not raining, so it could have already rained and they were in the house. What is that, a body? or is that the dog's? I don't know. Mother looks like she is glad to get rid of that dinner
