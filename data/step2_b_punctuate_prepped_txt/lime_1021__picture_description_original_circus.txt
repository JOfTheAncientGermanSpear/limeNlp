ok this is a circus picture, and there is a guy walking the tight rope. He has the balance bar with him. There are people, one, two, three, four, five, six people look like sitting on a bench watching him. There is a ring with a horse, and a lady is riding bareback on the horse, and he's going around the circle of the ring. And there are some children watching a clown, and the clown is throwing something on them that looks like it might be paper. The little girl is smiling, and the little boy is throwing his hands up thinking it's probably water. Inside, the, another ring is the man doing the lion taming, and he has the lion sitting up and possibly waving. And there's a little girl and her dad looking on at, looks like everything. And the whole circus seems to be outside, not inside a tent
