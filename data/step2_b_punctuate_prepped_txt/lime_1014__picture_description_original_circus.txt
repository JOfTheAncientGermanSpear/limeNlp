ok let's see. I know what it is but I can't say. Horse, I'm saying horse, not a horse. Well let's see, the man has the man who is trying to scratch, i know what it is, but I cant say it. Other guy who's wearing all the paint on his face, and the big fancy hair, and he's got water, and he's trying to put the water on to, it looks like water but it's not, it's something else, on to the boy and girl, and the mother, and the girl is turned around, and twirling around. A man up above is climbing up high up, well I can't say it, he's walking across the top. And on the very far right i see the lady's riding the horse, and the horse is just walking around. And she's getting ready to go upon her toes, but she just, but she's just sitting there. Let's see. Pardon me, I know what it is, but I cant say their names. Only thing i really say is the horse, I cant say horse.
