this is, looks like an old fashion kitchen. Mom's there, drying the dishes. The sink is over flowing, and of course, the kids wanted to get in the cookie jar. The cabinet is open. The boy's up on the stool, the stool is falling as he grabs a cookie for his little sister, who is re reaching for the cookie with her outstretched hand. Mom's feet are getting wet. Old fashioned kind of pull back curtains. The window's open, it must be a nice spring day out there. The kitchen looks pretty clean, except for the dirty dishes, and the flood that's happening on the floor. Let's hope mom doesn't ruin her shoes. Looks like mom might be wearing an apron too. Could be summer, spring, fall, leaves on the trees. Two bowl, dirty bowls, on the counter, one dirty plate on the counter. Not much to say about this. Little girl has shorts on, and little Mary Jane sandals. The boy has, I dont know, shorts on. Little t-shirt with a collar, bare leg socks. Girl has kind of medium hair, mom's got short hair. We've got two kitchen cabinets to the left side. Then we've got looks like two cabinets to the left side of the sink, two doors under the sink, two doors to the right of the sink, no cabinets over the window. I don't know if I said that, and I've got three cabinets above the counter to the left where the boy's stealing the cookies.
