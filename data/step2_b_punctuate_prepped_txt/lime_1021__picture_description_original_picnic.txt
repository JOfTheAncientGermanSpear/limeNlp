ok. This is a picture, looks like it's a lakeside. There is a sailboat on the lake, with two people in it and they're waving at the people on shore. There's a house with a car there. And there's a man out on the pier fishing, he just caught a fish. He has on a straw hat keeping the sun out of his face. There's a little girl playing in the sand, she's built a sandcastle, looks like she's really enjoying herself. There's a lady and a man, having a picnic lunch, she's pouring them something cold to drink. They have a radio so they can listen to music. The man is criss cross applesauce, reading a book. There is a little boy flying a kite, looks like he's really enjoying the kite. And he has I guess his dog with him. Dog looks very happy, the boy looks very happy, everybody in the picture looks really happy. It's a nice driveway, looks like it would be a really nice summer day. There's a flag flying outside the house. Nice shady tree in the yard. And the man has his shoes off.
