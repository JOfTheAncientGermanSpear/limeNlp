I've never seen that picture, but they look like they are at a lake, or a resort. Now outside having a picnic, and look like there's a bottle of wine she pouring in that glass. And daddy is reading a story. And they have music out there. The dog is having a good time, and the little girl, little sister's having a good time, makin her a sandcastle. And I see that the brother is over there catching fish to have for their supper. Then little brother is flying his kite, and the sailboat is sailing. And it's a beautiful day. And the house, the car that's at the house, is the car they drove to the, I said the resort, resort the first time, but that looks like it's just a house on the lake. And dog needs some water cause his tongue hangin out his mouth. And they have a little music at there by mother. And it's a little warm too cause everybody have on shorts, except for the fisherman. And the United States flag is flying, over the house. And the trees are green. And there's a Christmas tree by the house. And I guess the roads are paved, and the grass is cut and beautiful. And numbers four seventy is a sailboat, and it appears that only two people are on it sailboat. And it appears to be midday or so, because he's reading a book, and he can see outside. So I, it, it it's probably midday, cause the lunch is in the bag, in the basket
