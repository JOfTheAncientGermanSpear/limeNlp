Here we have let's say a family at the lake picnicking, and doing a bunch of other stuff. The daughter is building a sand castle, while, while her brother flies a kite, and runs with the dog. The dad is reading a book with his sandals off, while the mom is listening to music and, and maybe having wine therapy. The, there is like maybe, it almost looks like a park ranger, catching a fish, or a guy with like a wide brimmed cap, like a park ranger, and the fish is, jumping around on the line. So it's like he's about ready to land it. Looks to be pretty windy day because the flag is flying in the background, and there's enough wind to pick up the kite, and let it go. The a, there's some boaters in the background with the boat number four seventy, and it appears that there are two people on board. There are no other boats on the lake that we can see. The dad's book appears to be blank
