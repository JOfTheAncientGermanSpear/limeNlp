wow. This is a circus. Let's start at the top. We've got a tight ropewalker, balancing with his beam, starting to put his left foot down, he looks like he's in control. Moving down a little bit, we've got the lion in a, it's a round cage, on a lion's sitting up on his hind quarters, raising his left paw. In response to his lion trainer, who's raising his hand, his right hand, for the lion to raise his left paw. And the lion trainer has a nice little top hat on, he has a, looks like a tweed tux, kind of weird, com comber bun, dark pants. And the lion's upon a, upside down table, tub. Black and with stripes, very wide stripes. And watching the lion, I think is a little girl, unless she's looking at the clown. There's a man in the bottom right hand, bottom left hand corner, who's looking at the clown, who's in the middle of the picture. And then the man has a little girl with him, who has braided pigtails, with bows at the top, and bows at the bottom, and probably a little pinafore cause she's got a t-shirt on with a collar, and she's got stripes across the back. And she's pointing at either the lion or the clown. And the clown, the lion's in front of her, the clown is to her right a little bit. The clown has on striped pants, suspender pants, black and white, wide white stripes then black, and a flowered tie.
