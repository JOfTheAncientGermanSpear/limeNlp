ok. in the kitchen, mother's washing the, washing the dishes, of course the sink is over flowing. kids are getting rave, raving the cookie jar in the top cabinet. her son's about to fall over the stool. that's about it for that one. there's two cups, a plate on the counter, the counter. I see the flowers, the trees, and the bushes, out of the, bushes outside. looks like the garage over there the sidewalk. mom's wearing a dress. what am I missing here? mom look likes she's mad. the cabinets are empty. sister's saying he's about to fall. grass is trying to grow, not much. looks like a word right there, is that a word? like some sort of code. curtains are pulled or open
