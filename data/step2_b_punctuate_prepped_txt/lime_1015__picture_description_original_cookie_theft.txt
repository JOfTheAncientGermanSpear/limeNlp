well the woman is washing dishes, water's overflowing. The boy's falling off of school as he reaches for cookie, the girl is laughing. Looks like the window is open, there's dishes on the counter. The woman's holding a plate. She's wearing a dress with an apron. There's water on the floor. There's cabinets. There's a door open. There's curtains on the window. She's holding a rag. There's a house, I don't know if it's hers or not, bushes, trees, grass. There's a plate, two cups. And boy's wearing shorts. Shoes. Girl's wearing a dress and shoes.
