ok. Mom's washing the dishes. The sink is running over. The kids are getting into the cookie jar, and the boy's about to fall. He's handing the cookies down to the girl. It appears to be maybe summer time, or spring time cause she's got the window open. She's doesnt realize the sinks about to run over, now they're gonna have ta mop the floor. An that's about all I can think on that picture
