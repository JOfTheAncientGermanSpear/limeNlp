ok. Mother is washing, wiping the bish, the bishes. Water is flowing over the bitchen, kitchen, onto the floor. Water is running everywhere. And the little girls and boys, the boy is getting some cookies from the, and the mother ate and mother too, and little boy is falling, over the fid, the carl, the char, chair, chair. And the grass is out in the picture, kind of on the floor. And there is some dishes on the line up plate floor, that you cleaned, that mother has washed out, washed and wiped. And the water is running over the floor, and they will have to get them up. Well the girl hadn't got any cookies yet, off of, out of the jar. Don't know what this is. The water is running, the water is running, I see the mama, the mother, hadn't cut the water off, and it is running onto the floor.
