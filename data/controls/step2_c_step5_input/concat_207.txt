oh picnic scene. this is a picnic scene. the little boy with his kite, runnin’ it. his dog is chasin’ after him. and, the man on the dock fishing just caught a fish, everything good. little girl is on the beach buildin’ a sandcastle. and the mama and the daddy are fixin’ a picnic. mama’s pourin’ a drink, daddy’s readin’ a book. got the car in the driveway. house is right there on the beach. flag flyin’, a boat sailin’, people waving from the boat that’s sailin’, everybody’s happy in that picture. includin’ rover the dog. she must have music playing from a music box. it’s a fairly windy day because the kite’s got a long tail. and I think that’s it. ‘kay that’s all.alright, now we’re in the kitchen with the mama and she is frustrated because she is washin’ the dishes with the sink overflowing on the floor. her kids are behind her probably stealing cookies out of the cookie jar. and the stool is turning over, the little boy’s getting ready to have an accident which will add to it. and. the little girl’s participatin’ ‘cause she’s wantin’ one of the cookies. looks like she might be cryin’, could be, hard to tell from that picture. that’s all.this is a circus with a clown. got a, lion with the in the, in with the trainer. tightrope walker. people in the park looking on. a lady on a horse in the ring. lady with her baby and child. Looks like the popcorn is being thrown out or candy to the kid from the clown. and there’s a little girl who’s lookin’ on from the left pointing at the clown. and. the guy on the left is black, i think because of his hair. i don’t see much else.
