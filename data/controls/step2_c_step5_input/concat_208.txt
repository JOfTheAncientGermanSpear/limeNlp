we’re in the kitchen. and, mom is doing dishes and it looks like the sink it clogged and it is overflowing and she’s not noticing that the kids are raiding the cookie jar, but the boy who is standing on the stool is about to break his neck because the stool’s gonna fall.okay, so, we’re at a circus, and i see a clown who, threw some popcorn on some little kids. and a lion tamer in the cage, has the lion standing up on the stool. and there’s a tightraw, tightrope walker, going across and a woman, on a, top of a horse. i’m trying to think of what else i see. little girl is pointing to the clown.looks like we’re on a picnic down by the lake. and mom is pouring a glass of wine. and has a nice picnic basket there. and the boom box is playing some music while dad is reading. and the boy is, flying a kite while his dog is chasing him. there’s a man on a pier who caught a fish. and there’s another girl who’s in  the beach who’s making sand castles. and way out in the middle of the lake is a boat that’s, sailing down the lake.
