Okay i see a, gentleman tight, on tightrope, walking across a tightrope. and a young lady who is, balancing on a horse within the ring there. and some people that are observing her from behind the ring. and then within the cage i see a guy, a lion tamer that’s getting the lion to stand up on his hind legs. then I see what looks like a dad and his daughter and the daughter’s pointing at the clown, and the clown is, spilling, something, i don’t know, coins, i don’t know what, spilling something towards the little boy who’s with his mother and mother’s holding the little girl.

and this is a park scene. and so the woman’s pouring, soda i guess from the soda, bottle. and the gentleman’s reading a book, in bare feet. and there’s a, radio or something there. and the little boy’s flying a kite, the dog’s chasing after him, and the gentleman in the back who just caught a fish, and some people sailing on the sail boat, and the little girl in the foreground here is building a sandcastle. and in the back is a house with a car parked in front of the garage.
