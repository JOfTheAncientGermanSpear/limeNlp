we have a family on a picnic, and it looks like they’re at a lake and maybe they it’s a cottage that they own, I don’t know, across the little driveway from a lake. and on the lake, the family is sitting on a, let’s say a long rug or a big beach towel and mom is pouring something into a glass, now it looks like a wine bottle but i don’t know about that. and the dad is, and she’s got the picnic basket under the wine, or the glass and the bottle that she’s pouring from. dad is sitting on the other side of the basket and he’s reading a book, he’s got glasses on. his shoes are off to the side. to the side of mom is a a radio that they’re playing. Behind them but, and close to the water is a young boy who’s got a, a kite, and he’s running with the kite up in the air and his dog is chasing him. next to him is actually, it looks like, some sand. and it looks like there’s a young girl who is making, she’s got a bucket full of sand and she’s making a sandcastle. and she’s got a little shovel, got a ponytail, got her bathing suit on i think. and then just up a ways from her is a dock and there’s a fisherman on the dock with a fish on the end of the line. and out on the pond or the lake is a sailboat with two people in it. and there are trees in the background, and it’s just a really nice idyllic scene. the end.
