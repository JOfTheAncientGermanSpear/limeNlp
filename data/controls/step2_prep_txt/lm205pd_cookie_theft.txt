i see a sink running over, overflowing. i see a woman wiping a plate, front of the sink that the water is on the floor. i see a child on a stool bout ready to fall, he’s in the cookie jar. he may bring the cookie jar out with him when he falls. and then it looks like maybe the sister standing there, waiting for him to hand the cookie down. and I guess that’s about it.
