this is a, wow, kitchen scene. you have mom standing at the kitchen sink in front of a very large window with curtains, wiping some dishes and the sink is running over apparently she has not looked to notice that there’s water all over the floor. and it’s just cascading out of the sink so I don’t know why she can’t see that. behind her it, two children, one up on a three legged stool, the young boy, who’s taking cookies out of the cookie jar which is on the top shelf of the top cupboards. and, the stool is on two legs so it’s teetering, he’s going to fall. next to him is his sister who’s got her hand up waiting for the cookies to be handed down. it’s, outside the window it looks a picture of the outside of their house. you see, let’s say the garage and a sidewalk and, some grass, and that’s that.
