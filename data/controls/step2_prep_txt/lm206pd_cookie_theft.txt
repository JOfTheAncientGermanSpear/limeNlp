oh. mother is doin’ the dishes, the sink’s overflowed, and the little boy’s on a stool going in the cabinet jar to get cookies and he is about to fall over. and the little girl is reaching for the cookie, i don’t know if she’s gonna get it or not. and what is mother gonna do, she better call a plumber. looks like she’s got a problem there. oh my this could be disastrous. she’ll never dry that dish. because if that little boy falls it could be bad. his head could hit that counter, or the floor and i bet it’s hard hard floor. oh they’ve been in another cabinet too, cabinet’s door is open, maybe that’s where mama puts the plates. Maybe that’s not the cookie cab, and the snack cabinet. goodness. looks like they’ve almost got snow out there on the ground. the bushes just look like they’re covered with snow. but the window looks like it’s up. oh my mother’s standin’ in water now. that’s not good. they gon’ have all kinds of accidents in that kitchen. it looks like.
