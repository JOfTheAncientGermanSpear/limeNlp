okay, this is, a couple having a picnic, and there’s a lot going on. they’re, beside the lake. on the lake we have a sail boat. the sail boat has the number four seven zero on the sails. there’s two people on the boat. there’s also a small pier, going out into the water and on the pier is a man fishing, in fact he’s catching a fish, and he’s wearing one of those safari hats. on the beach of the lake is a girl who’s making a sand castle. she also has a shovel and a pail. we also have a boy flying a kite, running by with his dog. and, there’s a house by the lake also, there’s one car in the driveway. they also have a flagpole, with a flag flapping in the wind. back to our picnic, we have a couple. she seems to be pouring a beverage, the bottle looks like a wine bottle but it looks like a drinking glass not a wine glass. They have, a small, boom box so they’re probably listening to music. the man has taken his sandals off and he’s sitting on the blanket and reading a book. and they also have a picnic basket. and that’s about all i see.
