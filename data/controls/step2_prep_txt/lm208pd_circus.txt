okay, so, we’re at a circus, and i see a clown who, threw some popcorn on some little kids. and a lion tamer in the cage, has the lion standing up on the stool. and there’s a tightraw, tightrope walker, going across and a woman, on a, top of a horse. i’m trying to think of what else i see. little girl is pointing to the clown.
