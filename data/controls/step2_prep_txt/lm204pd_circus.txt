well this is a, looks like a circus venue. we have right in the front a clown who is, passing out popcorn by his through his bucket, probably ejecting it out of the bucket. behind him we have a lion sitting on a large round object with a lion tamer, and they’re in a cage, as it were. in front, next to the clown, who’s in front of the lion, we have a gentleman and his daughter, the daughter is pointing to the clown, to and that would be to the left of the picture but  the right of the clown. to the left of the clown, in the right of the picture is a mom, carrying a young child that looks like a girl with a ponytail, and her brother who is got his hands up grabbing the popcorn that’s coming out of the bucket. behind them and off to the right of the cage with the lion in it is a round circle and there is a horse in it, with a lot of stuff on the horse and a thing coming off his head like a, like a, i wanna say feathers or something. and on him is a young lady who looks like a ballerina with a fluflu on and she’s got her arms stretched out straight and her knees bent riding the horse, who’s prancing with his tail up. and there’s a, one two three four five six people, five or six people sitting, on a bench on the far side of the the ring, that they’re going around with the the lady on the horse. and it looks like it’s a family in descending order. and they’re in black so you don’t see any faces. and above all of the is a gentleman who is a, tightrope walker.
