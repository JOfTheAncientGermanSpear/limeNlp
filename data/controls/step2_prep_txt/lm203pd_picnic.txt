okay it’s a family picnic. there’s, son flying a kite. a sailboat on the water. a girl playing in the sand, building a sand castle. There’s a fellow fishing, has a fish on the line from a, pier. There’s a flagpole with a flag. A house with a car in the, garage, or half, going into the garage. A tree in the front. Mom and dad, dad’s enjoying a book, got his shoes off, his sandals off. mom is pouring, we’ll say wine. picnic basket, she’s got some music playing on the radio. and they having just a nice fun family outing, on a pretty day.
