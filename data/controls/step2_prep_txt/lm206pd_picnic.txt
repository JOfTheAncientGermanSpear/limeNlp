oh, picnic. a guy is reading on the book. and the lady is pourin’ a glass of wine. they have their radio on. and it looks like it’s just a lake or pond, someone’s fishin’, little boy playin’ with a kite and runnin’ and his dog’s runnin’ with him, and little girl over on the beach sand buildin’ a, castle. there’s a sailboat out in the pond. with it appears two people in the sail boat. oh it is windy day because the flag is flying out. yes. but there’s a house across the street from this place. so I don’t know, this must be, a private pond or their place. ‘cause a house shouldn’t be in a public pond or lake or recreation area, so that’s very interesting. that’s a pretty house. that’s a big tree, that tree is probably pretty old, to be that big. looks like they’ve got a little, christmas trees, beside the front door, i bet they put lights on it at christmas and decorate it. and i just wonder about that car sittin’ in the front, driveway, i bet it can’t go in the garage because the garage is full of stuff.
