okay, there is a man in a cage with a lion and he seems to be training the lion or taming the lion i guess. in the foreground there’s a clown and he is throwing things out of a bucket, to three people which is a mother and two kids. she’s holding the younger child, which looks like a girl and the older child’s a boy. there’s another couple in the foreground, maybe african american, a father and daughter and they’re pointing, the girl is pointing at the clown. in the background we have a woman performing on horseback. she is wearing some sort of tutu and she seems to be kneeling on the back of the horse. there is an audience of five people watching her. we can’t see them very well because they’re in shadow. overhead we have a tightrope walker and he is dressed in all black and he is carrying a balancing bar, i don’t know what you call that. back to the lion in the cage the lion tamer’s wearing, a dress coat with tails and a top hat. and there seems to be some trees in the background and the terrain slopes from the right to the left.
