okay I see a boy and a girl. the boy’s on a ladder, well on a stool and it’s turning over, he’s gonna fall and get hurt but he’s gonna get a cookie out of the cookie jar which is in the cabinet. his mother is not payin’ attention to the kids, she’s tryin’ to wash dishes, the sink is overflowin’, she’s standin’ in the water. there’s some dishes on the counter to be washed I presume. there’s a side walk. there’s a window to look out with curtains. a sidewalk.  there bushes out there in the yard, some grass. let’s  see. the boy has on shorts and the girl has on a skirt. that’s about. the mother has on an apron, a drying cloth in her hand or dish cloth so. it’s a little disaster area.
