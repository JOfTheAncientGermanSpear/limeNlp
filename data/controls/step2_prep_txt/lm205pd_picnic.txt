okay I see, a boy flyin’ a kite, a dog runnin’ along with him. i see somebody over there fishing. there’s a child making like a sandcastle. and there, looks like a sailboat out in the water. and then it looks like a man and woman having a piclick, picnic lunch, they’ve got a radio there. and then there’s the house with the tree in front, the car in the yard. that’s it.
