alright, now we’re in the kitchen with the mama and she is frustrated because she is washin’ the dishes with the sink overflowing on the floor. her kids are behind her probably stealing cookies out of the cookie jar. and the stool is turning over, the little boy’s getting ready to have an accident which will add to it. and. the little girl’s participatin’ ‘cause she’s wantin’ one of the cookies. looks like she might be cryin’, could be, hard to tell from that picture. that’s all.
