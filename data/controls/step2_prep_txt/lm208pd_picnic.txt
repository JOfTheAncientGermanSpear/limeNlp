looks like we’re on a picnic down by the lake. and mom is pouring a glass of wine. and has a nice picnic basket there. and the boom box is playing some music while dad is reading. and the boy is, flying a kite while his dog is chasing him. there’s a man on a pier who caught a fish. and there’s another girl who’s in  the beach who’s making sand castles. and way out in the middle of the lake is a boat that’s, sailing down the lake.
