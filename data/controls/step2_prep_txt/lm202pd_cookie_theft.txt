alright, this is a picture i’ve seen before. at the kitchen sink is mom. mom is drying a plate. while she’s doing that she seems to be oblivious to the sink, which is overflowing onto the floor, even where she’s standing. out the window you can see what looks like maybe a driveway or a walkway and another part of the house. also on the counter we have a plate and maybe two coffee cups. in the background further away in the kitchen, are the two kids. the boy is standing on a stool trying to reach the cookies in the cookie jar up in the cupboard. what he doesn’t realize, or i guess his mistake was that he’s losing his balance and the stool is falling over to the right. his sister is, on the floor, standing on the floor. she’s reaching up to get the cookie from her brother and she seems like maybe she’s laughing at her brother also. in the window we also have some curtains. mom seems to be wearing a half apron over her dress. it must be warm weather because the brother and sister, the boy’s wearing shorts and a short sleeve shirt and his sister has a short dress on. And that’s all I can see.
