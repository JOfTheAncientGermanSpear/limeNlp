oh picnic scene. this is a picnic scene. the little boy with his kite, runnin’ it. his dog is chasin’ after him. and, the man on the dock fishing just caught a fish, everything good. little girl is on the beach buildin’ a sandcastle. and the mama and the daddy are fixin’ a picnic. mama’s pourin’ a drink, daddy’s readin’ a book. got the car in the driveway. house is right there on the beach. flag flyin’, a boat sailin’, people waving from the boat that’s sailin’, everybody’s happy in that picture. includin’ rover the dog. she must have music playing from a music box. it’s a fairly windy day because the kite’s got a long tail. and I think that’s it. ‘kay that’s all.
