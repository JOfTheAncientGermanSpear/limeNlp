alright. a family is outside their what maybe be their home. looks like a home on either the lake, yeah lake and. there is a little boy flying a kite, his dog is chasing him. looks like mom and dad are setting up a picnic, and dad is reading a book, mom is pouring some sort of beverage into a cup. someone is on the dock, fishing, and he’s caught a fish. little girl to the, my, my right of the boy, appears to be making a sandcastle with her, toys. there’s a sailboat on the lake. let’s see. in the background there’s a house with a car on the driveway. and, there’s a tree and shrubs in front of the house. can see a couple windows and a door and a garage door and roof, let’s see. back with the, mom and dad on the, picnic blanket, he’s got his, relaxing with his sandals off, and she’s got a, cd player, perhaps listening to the radio or, cd. let’s see. that’s about all I can remark on.
