O wow this is at a picnic o are they at home I kinda wonder if their at home because the what looks like a house with the car in the front has a flag post and a flag so that may or may not be a house but it has a garage that's that's kind of an odd thing I've never seen anyone with an actual flag post and posted in the front yard that's odd too that they have a driveway that goes in front of the house yeah that's really weird so I guess not   cause it looks like there's a walkway to the front door and then you have the mother and the father and the child I see some sandals those must belong to the little girl who's playing with sand and he's reading a book no maybe those are his shoes but those look like girl sandals that's kinda odd and she's she's just pouring a drink and over to the far end is is a man and he is fishing there's a lot to do in this picture there's boating  and then he's flying the kite and he's running and the dog is chasing him but that's just really odd that house is just interesting   I don't know what it is about that house but the boat is out there this this could at like lake Murry and somnebody lives on the doc on the lake and they have a dock   and that's just you know a friend out there fishing but
