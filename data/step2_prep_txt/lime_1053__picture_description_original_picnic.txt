O this looks like this is not a beach house but this is a lake house it looks like and it's in the summertime even though it's a little early or   probably   little   late in the spring for them to be flying a kite even though it has a tail on it and also has a cord wrapped around so he can guide and keep the the kite from going into the sky there's the water on the lake and there's a sailboat and there's a special number on there for the number four seven zero I don't know what it's for but it's for that's a guy that's there on the dock and   and it's extending into the water and he's got a fishing pole   and he's pulling a fish out of the lake and it's splashing as the fish is messing around there I see the pretty leaves on the on the on the big tree out there and nice bushes and everything a nice clean cut house and a nice car parked in the garage although it's only a single car garage  I don't know what that's a flag it might might be   something special that that they call or its for where they live it looks like mommy and daddy are sitting there doing a t picnic   they both have their sandals on there's a transistor type radio or a boom box I guess they call it and I don't know if that's ginger ale or beer probably beer and their got their leisure clothes on he's reading a book that's the picnic basket and it's full of sandwiches and hot dogs and hamburgers I mean I've never seen so many in my life and there's the doggie and his name is obviously Bowzer and he's got his tag on means he's in good shape so
