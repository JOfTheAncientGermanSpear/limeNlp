I see a little whos asking for a cookies apparently from her brother who in on the stool about to fall hes reaching for cookies he has one in his had probably one for himself and one for her the cabinet door is open while mother is diligently a drying dishes while the sink is running over it is obviously plugged up and she has two dishes rather than three so I wonder why not she must have just feed her children cause theres only two and as I look ouside I see a nice path that obviously leads to a garage or to the home next door and it must be spring time because there are trees and bushes and mothers gonna slip if shes not careful because the water is under her feet and she seems to be oblivious to it or she is showing a bit of dismay on her face if not shes certainly not smiling but she is also seemingly ignoring her children and the and the one little girl seems to be saying shhh to the boy so that mom doesn't notice but she will when it goes crash and all the lower cabinet doors are closed and apparently she put the cookies up top so they wouldn't bother them but they have found their way to them and thats about all I can see
